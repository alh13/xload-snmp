Requirements:

To build xload-snmp you need to have the headers and libs for UCD SNMP
as well as the regular X11 stuff. UCD SNMP is available at
http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

Installation:

Is straightforward. Do:

~$ xmkmf -a
~$ make
~# make install install.man

USAGE:

The new executable will do everything the old xload did, plus some new
SNMP-related flags. A typical invocation to monitor the load of the host
systhug would look like:

~$ xload -peername 'systhug' -community ~/.server-load -oid 'laLoadFloat.1'

Read the manpage for more details.

TODO:

I'm not really familiar with SNMP, or Xt, so there should probably be lots
of crossbar testing with various SNMP servers to make sure it works like
it should.

I think we're going to need a flag for some sort of scaling
factor. i.e. some SNMP daemons will return an integer of 1000 for a float
value of 1.000. If the daemon returns a string "1.000" (or "1000"!) we
should be able to deal with that too.

Folding back in with the main xload source base would be nice. Does anyone
maintain that?

Binary packages.
