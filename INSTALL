Requirements:

To build xload-snmp you need to have the headers and libs for Net (UCD) SNMP
as well as the regular X11 stuff. Net SNMP is available at
http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net

Installation:

Is straightforward. Do:

~$ xmkmf -a
~$ make
~# make install install.man

USAGE:

The new executable will do everything the old xload did, plus some new
SNMP-related flags. A typical invocation to monitor the load of the host
systhug would look like:

~$ xload -peername 'systhug' -community ~/.server-load -oid 'laLoadFloat.1'

Or an alternative with the -factor option:

~$ xload -peername 'systhug' -community ~/.server-load -oid 'laLoadInt.1' \
   -factor 100

Read the manpage for more details.

TODO:

I'm not really experienced with SNMP, or Xt, so there should probably be
lots of crossbar testing with various SNMP servers to make sure it works
like it should.

We don't yet deal with return values which might be strings. i.e. a string
result of "1.000" should be acceptable. If we get a string that's not a
number we should gracefully... exit? not plot?

64 bit integer return values are also not tested. The value into which we
are storing the returned SNMP data is a double, I'm just not sure how it
will react to a 64 bit return value.

Binary packages.

I've found a GtkStripChart widget. If it's any good I might try switching
to Gtk. Why? I think it would be neat if you could mouse over a point on
the histogram and a tool tip would tell you what _time_ that point was
plotted. This would probably be easier to do by adding to or subclassing
GtkStripChart than by staying with Athena. Gtk would allow me an escape
from Athena and Xt lossage in general.
