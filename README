xload-snmp adds SNMP querying abilities to the venerable xload
program. This makes it capable to use xload for graphing anything
SNMPable. Disk usage, router traffic, anything with an OID.

To build you will need the net-snmp libraries. Obtain with your distro's
package manager or from http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net.

I haven't made any changes to this code for quite some time, but I tried
compiling it and running it on CentOS 5 and it still works!
